<h2><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>An Interactive Visualization of Dr. John Snow's Map of London's 1854 Cholera Epidemic &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span></h2>

<h4>Design Process</h4>

<p>The first thing I did for this project was to simply sketch my rough ideas on a paper. Since the map and the timeline graph are the main components of this visualization project, I started by drawing those two side by side. From there, I wrote down their interactivities as well as the requirements for each of them. As shown in the first sketch below, I used arrows to help me organize my thoughts on order of executions. </p>
